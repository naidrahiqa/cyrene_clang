# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions when using CyreneClang.

## Build Issues

### "Not enough disk space"

**Cause:** GitHub Actions runner has limited disk (~25GB).

**Solution:**
- The build script automatically cleans up during build
- If still failing, try `ENABLE_PGO=false` for single-pass build
- Check `df -h /` to verify available space

### "Compiler doesn't support '-fuse-ld=lld'"

**Cause:** Runtimes sub-build fails with cross-compilation.

**Solution:**
- This is fixed in recent versions
- Ensure you're using the latest build.sh
- The fix uses `CMAKE_LINKER` instead of `-DLLVM_USE_LINKER=lld`

### "git clone failed"

**Cause:** Network issues on CI runners.

**Solution:**
- Build script now retries 3 times automatically
- Manual retry usually succeeds
- Check if GitHub is accessible

### Stage 2 fails with "ld.lld not found"

**Cause:** PATH not set correctly for Stage 2.

**Solution:**
- Build script prepends Stage 1 bin to PATH
- Ensure Stage 1 completed successfully
- Check `ls build/stage1-install/bin/` for binaries

## Installation Issues

### "clang: not found"

**Cause:** PATH not configured.

**Solution:**
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/toolchains/cyrene/bin:$PATH"
# Add to ~/.bashrc for persistence
```

### "ld: not found"

**Cause:** Missing ld symlink.

**Solution:**
```bash
cd $HOME/toolchains/cyrene/bin
ln -sf $(which ld.lld) ld
```

### Wrong libc++ version

**Cause:** System libc++ conflicts with toolchain.

**Solution:**
- CyreneClang bundles its own libc++
- Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to toolchain lib dir
- Or use `LD_PRELOAD` with toolchain's libc++.so

## Kernel Build Issues

### "Kernel < 5.0 does not support LTO"

**Cause:** LTO enabled for old kernel.

**Solution:**
```bash
bash scripts/kernel-build.sh <kernel-dir> --lto=off
```

### Many warnings with kernel 4.x

**Cause:** Modern Clang is stricter than older versions.

**Solution:**
- Use `kernel-build.sh` which auto-applies warning suppression
- Or manually add `-Wno-*` flags

### "undefined reference to __gnu_mcount_nc"

**Cause:** Kernel needs specific ARM configuration.

**Solution:**
- Ensure `CONFIG_HAVE_KPROBES=y` in defconfig
- Or disable CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER

## CI/CD Issues

### Build timeout

**Cause:** PGO build takes 3+ hours on GitHub Actions.

**Solution:**
- Build timeout is set to 6 hours
- Use `ENABLE_PGO=false` for faster testing
- Check if disk cleanup is working

### Release not publishing

**Cause:** Release tag or permissions issue.

**Solution:**
- Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has write permissions
- Check if release tag format is correct
- Verify the tarball was created
